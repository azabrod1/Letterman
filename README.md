# Letterman

WELCOME TO LETTERMAN!  
This game is an arcade variation of the ancient "code-breaking" game JOTTO, also known as MASTERMIND, BULLS & COWS, or simply WORD. While the rules are simple, the game is surprisingly entertaining and can be quite challenging. Be prepared to devise advanced strategies and freshen up your vocabulary!

HOW TO PLAY:  You have ten attempts to guess a secret word, consisting of 5 unique letters. Type up to five letters and you will be given a two-number clue, such as 3/4. This means that you guessed the correct 4 letters, three of them being in the right position. Your guesses can include repeated letters or even blanks.  

FOR EXAMPLE,  if the secret word is ROBIN, the guess BORIN will result in a clue 3/5 (all letters are matching the secret word, three are in the right position); the guess ABBKA will result in a clue 1/2 (two letters, albeit identical, are matching the secret word, one is in the right position) and so on.

Good luck!
